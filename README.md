# MagicReport

An easy way to export data to CSV

[![Build Status](https://github.com/thefaded/magic-report/workflows/test/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/thefaded/magic-report/actions)

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "magic-operation"
```

## Getting Started

This gem provides an ActiveRecord-like DSL to create CSV reports. One of the common use cases is when you have nested data.

```ruby
class User < MagicReport::Report
  field :id
  field :is_admin, ->(user) { user.is_admin ? "Yes" : "No" }
end

report = User.new
report.process(UserModel.first)

# You can also `process` on a collection
# report.process(User.all.limit(50))

report.as_csv
```

The example above is basic - you have a User model and you want to export the two fields `id` and `is_admin`.
The users of your application may not particularly like the naming `true` or `false` since these are more technical terms, that's why you can pass an additional block to the field.

Also, for each report you must provide locales file:

```yaml
en:
  magic_report:
    headings:
      user:
        id: ID
        is_admin: Admin?
```

CSV will be
| ID | Admin? |
| ---- | -------- |
| 123 | Yes |
| 222 | No |

## Nested

Let's look at a more complex example. Now we have a user model with an address and several cars.

```ruby
class User < MagicReport::Report
  field :id
  field :is_admin, ->(user) { user.is_admin ? "Yes" : "No" }

  has_one :shipping_address, class: Address, prefix: -> { t("shipping_address") }
  has_one :billing_address, class: Address, prefix: -> { t("billing_address") }

  has_many :cars, class: Car, prefix: -> { t("car") }
end

class Address < MagicReport::Report
  fields :address_line_1, :city
end

class Car < MagicReport::Report
  field :name
end
```

Because we have explicitly said that the user `has_many :cars`, the number of lines in the CSV will be equal to the number of cars.

```yaml
en:
  magic_report:
    headings:
      user:
        id: ID
        is_admin: Admin?
        address: User address
        cars: Car
        shipping_address: Shipping address
        billing_address: Billing address
      car:
        name: Name
      address:
        address_line_1: Line 1
        city: City
```

CSV will be
| ID | Admin? | Shipping address Line 1 | Shipping address City | Billing address Line 1 | Billing address City | Car Name |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | -------- | ------- |
| 123 | Yes | 5th Ave | NY | Chester st | San Francisco | Lexus |
| 123 | Yes | 5th Ave | NY | Chester st | San Francisco | BMW |

### Using with blocks

The above example can be rewritten using blocks instead of class

```ruby
class User < MagicReport::Report
  field :id
  field :is_admin, ->(user) { user.is_admin ? "Yes" : "No" }

  # You should always provide `name` option if you're using block instead of class
  # From this option will be used locales for `address_line_1` and `city`
  has_one :shipping_address, name: :address, prefix: -> { t("shipping_address") } do
    fields :address_line_1, :city
  end
  # Prefix locale is taken from `user.billing_address`
  has_one :billing_address, name: :address, prefix: -> { t("billing_address") } do
    fields :address_line_1, :city
  end

  has_many :cars, name: :car, prefix: -> { t("car") } do
    field :name
  end
end
```
